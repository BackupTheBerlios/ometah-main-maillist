Subject: [Ometah-main] Fwd: 1st International Conference on Computational
 Logistics (ICCL), Shanghai, 20-22 Sept. 2010
Message-ID: <4C346D8B.2090300@econ.uni-hamburg.de>


Dear Colleague,

We invite you and your colleagues to submit papers to the 1st
International Conference on Computational Logistics (ICCL) to be held in
Shanghai, 20-22 September 2010.

Computational Logistics concentrates on methods and information systems
that support or perform the planning and control of logistics systems
and processes. Computational Logistics involves the use of information
systems and modern information and communication technology (IT) for the
design, planning and control of logistics networks as well as the
complex tasks within them.

Further information can be found on:
http://gauss.econ.uni-hamburg.de/iccl2010/
or
http://iccl2010.org/

Conference Dates: September 20-22, 2010
Conference Venue: Radisson (Century Park), Pudong District, Shanghai
Extended Abstract Submission Deadline: July 15, 2010
August 5, 2010: Notification of Acceptance/Rejection
Early Registration Due: August 15, 2010
Registration Fee:
	250 Euros as Full Early Registration
	100 Euros as Special Early Registration for Students

In case you are interested, the deadline for the submission of extended
abstract of up to 4 pages is approaching quickly. Kindly send them by 15
July 2010 by e-mail to: ICCL at econ.uni-hamburg.de

If you are interested to organize special sessions, kindly let us know
by July 15th, too.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us. The organizing
committee is looking forward to welcoming you in Shanghai! This is also
a good opportunity even to visit the EXPO in Shanghai at a time when it
is most pleasant to do so.

Best regards,

Hao Hu (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China)

Subject: [Ometah-main] IFORS 2011 - Metaheuristics session (invitation)
Message-ID: <4C4E8053.4040206@econ.uni-hamburg.de>


Dear list members,

As Stream Organizers for Metaheuristics at the next IFORS Meeting, that
will be held in Melbourne (Australia) on 10?15 July 2011, see
http://www.ifors2011.org/ , Celso Ribeiro and I are pleased to invite
you to organize and chair a session on a Metaheuristics theme of your
choice. One session comprises three to four invited papers. If you are
interested to do so, kindly let us know and you will get access to the
system.

Moreover, if you like to submit a paper for our stream, you can use the
abstract system on the website of the conference to do so.

Best regards,
Stefan
