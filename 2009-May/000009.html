INTELLIGENT DECISION SUPPORT FOR LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

 

Part of the Decision Technologies and Service Sciences Track

 

FORTY-THIRD ANNUAL HAWAI'I INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES

 

January 5 - 8, 2010

The Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort &amp; Spa, Kauai, Hawaii, U.S.A.

            

 

 

 

Minitrack Description

 

Information technology (IT) is a prerequisite for successful supply chain
management (SCM) today and will become even more so in near future. The
logistics and SCM field is developing very dynamically. Business-to-business
transactions are made via the Internet and enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems that manage the transactional information within the
enterprise. While IT systems are vital components in supply chains, their
successful management rests on intelligent and coordinated decision making
throughout the logistics network. Intelligent decision support using
advanced decision technologies are becoming increasingly important in
logistics and SCM. Data warehouses and data mining can be used to store and
analyze product, inventory, and sales information. Simulation and
optimization, which can be found in advanced planning and scheduling
systems, can be employed for, e.g., inventory, production, procurement, and
distribution planning. Intelligent agents can e.g. communicate with
different partners in the supply chain, assist in collecting information,
share product information, negotiate prices, and distribute alerts
throughout the logistics networks. The design and implementation of
intelligent decision technologies to support human agents in logistics and
SCM is a very active field in research, consulting and software development.
Many such technologies or systems have been implemented recently or are
currently in the stage of implementation. We do, therefore, believe that
this minitrack will be recognized by both the scientific community and
practitioners developing or using logistics and SCM solutions. We seek
papers dealing with decision technologies which contribute to intelligent
decision support in the whole field of logistics and in particular in all
categories of SCM. This includes but is not restricted to simulation,
optimization, heuristics, metaheuristics, agent technologies, descriptive
models, data warehousing, and data mining. We are especially interested in
real-world applications and in software solutions which assist in solving
decision problems. This is extended towards, e.g., advanced planning systems
and the intelligent use of enterprise resource planning systems. Also
conceptual ideas, reports on projects in progress, and case studies are
welcome. Moreover, teaching cases both at the university as well as the
executive level may be of interest.

Instructions for Paper Submissions

 

    * Submit your full paper (pdf) to the Peer Review System according to
the formatting and submission instructions which will be available on the
HICSS website. Papers are limited to 10 pages (double-column, font size 10
pt).

    * HICSS conferences are devoted to advances in the information,
computer, and system sciences, and encompass developments in both theory and
practice. HICSS will conduct double-blind reviews of each submitted paper.
Those selected for publication will be published in the Conference
Proceedings (IEEE).

    * HICSS papers must contain original material not previously published,
or currently submitted elsewhere. Do not submit the manuscript to more than
one Minitrack. If unsure of which Minitrack is appropriate, submit abstract
to the Track Chair for guidance.
