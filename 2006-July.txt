Hello,

I want to let you know that I'm doing a presentation of oMetah during the 7th 
Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre (also known as Libre Software 
Meeting). The meeting will held on July 4th-8th 2006 in Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, 
in the "1er cycle" building of the Facult? des Sciences, campus of Henri 
Poincar? - Nancy 1 University.

This is a worldwide meeting for developers and those involved in the free 
software community. Every year, more than fifty nationalities are 
represented. According to the specific work methodologies of free software 
development, this event is an unique occasion for people to meet each other, 
to show their works, to share their knowledge and to exchange with end-users 
on a non-business basis.

The oMetah presentation is in the "Science" topic, the 7th of july at 11:35am.
